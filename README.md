Description:

QT creator was used to design the GUI as well as program with the IDE in c++. This was because it 
offers a wide range of built in libaries as well as signal-slot mechanism making it ideal for GUI 
applications.

This project was made to familiarise myself with QT creator for potential future projects requiring
GUI's,
